<center>
<h3 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Vanilla has become a standard in coffee shops. 
<br>The subtle flavor of vanilla pairs perfectly with coffee. 
<br>French vanilla also enhances coffee with a pleasant aromatic touch.
<br>Coffee shop owners canâ€™t go wrong with mocha on the menu. You have a nice blend of coffee, chocolate, and milk with this flavor. By adding chocolate, you get a level of sweetness and richness.</h3>
