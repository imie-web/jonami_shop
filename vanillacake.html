<h2 style="font-family:'Monospace'"> Vanilla Cake </h2>
<center>
<h3 style="font-family:'Courier New'">I always thought that there were so many of these recipes out there that I’d stick to more unique ones. 
<br>But really, I think the world needs my version of this simple, classic, delicious flavor combination.
<br>
<br>Truthfully, most of my cakes use this vanilla cake recipe, but I’ve never paired it with a vanilla buttercream.
<br>I know it’s easy enough for some people to grab a cake recipe from one post and a frosting recipe from another, but for those of us that are a little less comfortable mixing and matching for fear of epic failures, I’m putting it together for you into one recipe</h3>
